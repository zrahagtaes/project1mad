What the best methood for deleting cards was for our log section and GPT sugested: Slidables 
for deleting logs and gave the pubscep.yaml. I also researched on youtube to understand 
how it worked to incorperate it into our logs.

DB_helper helper for the sqlite was being problematic so I used Chatgpt to help troubleshoot 
and Debug for me and I also used it to show me how to write the SQL for the SQLite part of the db 
helper file. Even after the implementation of the database at first wasnt working so I used ChatGpt 
to show me how to use the try and catch and exception as e statments to debug and catch were the issue. 
(my information / logs were not saving)

My emulator was being slow and said "too much work on main thread", used ChatGPT to explain the problem. Used different settings in order to have it properly run.
